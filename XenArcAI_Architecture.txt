XenArcAI Architecture Description:

XenArcAI is a transformer-based neural network architecture designed for text generation. It consists of the following key components:

1. Embedding Layer: Maps input tokens to a high-dimensional vector space.
2. Positional Encoding: Adds positional information to the embeddings to capture the order of tokens in the input sequence.
3. Transformer Encoder: A stack of transformer encoder layers that learn contextual representations of the input sequence.
4. Linear Layer: Maps the output of the transformer encoder to the vocabulary space for token prediction.

The architecture is trained using a cross-entropy loss function and optimized with the Adam optimizer. Gradient clipping is used to prevent exploding gradients, and a learning rate scheduler is used to adjust the learning rate during training. A validation loop is included to monitor performance on unseen data.
