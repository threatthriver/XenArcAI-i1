# XenArc AI Prototype â€“ Indian Language Model

Model Name: XenArc-India

(This model is specifically designed for Indian languages and adheres to resource constraints.)

## Core Features:

- LSTM-based Language Model
  - Basic LSTM architecture for text generation.
- Character-level Tokenization
  - Simple character-level tokenizer for Indian languages.
- 128k Context Length
  - Limited context window for resource efficiency.

## Prototype Implementation Plan:

- Data Collection & Preprocessing
  - Load data from a local text file (data/indian_text.txt).
  - Create a character-level tokenizer.
- Model Training
  - Train the LSTM model on the Indian text data.
  - Save model checkpoints during training.
- Text Generation
  - Generate text using the trained model.

## Final Goal:

XenArc-India aims to create a resource-friendly language model for Indian languages, demonstrating the feasibility of training such models from scratch.
