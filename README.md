# XenArc AI: Odysee Gen 1 - A Language Model

## Architecture: XenArcAI

## Core Features:

- Transformer Encoder-based Language Model
  - Increased number of Transformer Encoder layers for improved performance.
- Character-level Tokenization
  - Simple character-level tokenizer.
- 128k Context Length
  - Context window for resource efficiency.
- Dropout Regularization
  - Dropout layer added to the Transformer Encoder for regularization.
- Positional Encoding
  - Positional encoding added to the input embeddings.
- Gradient Clipping
- Learning Rate Scheduler
- Validation Loop

## Implementation Plan:

- Data Collection & Preprocessing
  - Load data from a local text file (data/indian_text.txt).
  - Create a character-level tokenizer.
- Model Training
  - Train the Transformer Encoder model.
  - Save model checkpoints during training.
  - Implement validation loop.
  - Implement learning rate scheduler.
  - Implement gradient clipping.
- Text Generation
  - Generate text using the trained model.

## Final Goal:

XenArc AI aims to create a language model, demonstrating the feasibility of training such models from scratch. This prototype is known as Odysee Gen 1, built on the XenArcAI architecture.
